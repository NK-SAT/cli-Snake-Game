# 🐍 Snake Game (Java CLI Edition)

Ever felt bored and instead of playing a game, thought — *why not build one?*

That idea turned into this nostalgic, logic-powered **Snake Game**, built entirely in **Java** using basic concepts like arrays, loops, and OOP. This project runs in your terminal and is a fun way to reinforce core CS fundamentals while letting your inner 90s kid have some fun.
